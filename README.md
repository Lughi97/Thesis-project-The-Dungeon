# Thesis-project-The-Dungeon
# Project Idea 
This prototype thesis project is a showcase of procedural content generation in a rogue-like game, where the player has to reach the exit of each dungeon.
The player can find in each level different types of weapons and armor that can be equipped through a simple inventory. Also, the player can find different types of potions  (healing, mana, stamina, and attack boosters).  in order to survive the level.
The main hazards are the poison gas that depletes the player's health and the enemy, who have simple AI mechanics in which they find and chase the player.
It also is implemented a simple combat system that notifies the player of how much damage its dealing and receiving.
